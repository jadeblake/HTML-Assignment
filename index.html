  <h2>The Early History</h2>
  <p>
    Las Vegas began as a small stop for trains in the early 1900s. It was officially founded in 1905 and was mostly a quiet desert town. The city grew quickly after the Hoover Dam was built nearby in the 1930s, which brought many workers and their families to the area. In 1931, Nevada made gambling legal, which changed everything for Las Vegas. Casinos started to open, and the city became famous as a place where people could come to try their luck. Over time, Las Vegas grew into the large, lively city known around the world today.
